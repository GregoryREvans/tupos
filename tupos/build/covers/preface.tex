\leftskip3in
In the neuter austerity of that terrain all phenomena were bequeathed a strange equality and no one thing nor spider nor stone nor blade of grass could put forth claim to precedence. The very clarity of these articles belied their familiarity, for the eye predicates the whole on some feature or part and here was nothing more luminous than another and nothing more enshadowed and in the optical democracy of such landscapes all preference is made whimsical and a man and a rock become endowed with unguessed kinship.

\pmb{Non-power-of-2 denominated time signatures} : In this work, some measures are durated by a time signature with a denominator which is not a power of 2. ``In each case, the principle applicable to the derivation of more conventional meters (understood as subdivisions of a whole note) is maintained. For example, $\frac{2}{10}$ signifies a bar composed of two beats, each of which is equal to one-tenth of a whole note.'' Just as in much contemporary music where the time signatures of compound meters do not prolate the contents of their measures (e.g. a quarter note in $\frac{6}{8}$ and in $\frac{3}{4}$ are fundamentally the same speed) so too do these unusual time signatures preserve the basic metronomic tempo. \\

\pmb{Accidentals} : After temporary accidentals, cancellation marks are printed also in the following measure (for notes in the same octave) and, in the same measure, for notes in other octaves, but they are printed again if the same note appears later in the same measure, except if the note is immediately repeated. \\
